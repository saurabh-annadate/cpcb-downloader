Description:
Downloading air pollutant data from the CPCB websit is a tedious task. The user needs to fill forms in differnet stages, which involves human input at various stages.
I have automated the task and the user can downlaod the data from all the stations by simply providing the date range. Moreover, data for individual states can also be downloaded.
